- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikeSantos, aka Chronus in flight simming and racing sims, aka DeKalbIron in FPS (UT2004, Doom, BF2, BF3, BF4, Titanfall 1 and 2...and Apex Legends).

- 👀 I’m interested in racing simulations, flight simulations and FIRST Person Shooters. I am also an avid science-fiction literature fan, a swimming and fitness nut.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning many new things - one of them being Lua, new things about Python, C++, C#, Physics and Math (my favourite subjects). Oh yeah, I have been diving into 
Unreal Engine 4 (fascinating) and ML.

- 💞️ I have been a consultant for Defence contractors, automative companies, racing teams and racing simulation studios. 

- 📫 How to reach me ...I'll reach people first.
